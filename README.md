# MyReads Project

This is an application to organize your books to shelves.
You can easily have an overview of your books on the shelves, change the bookshelf or add a new book.

## Setup

In order to start the project, make sure you follow these steps:
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
